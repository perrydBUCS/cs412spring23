Hey, everybody, congrats on getting a seat in CS412 Expanded Edition, now with more seats than ever before! I've posted a syllabus and rough schedule on Piazza, over on the Resources tab. I'll also add a 'handy links' post later today.

The course is probably different from those you've taken here so far in that it is pretty much just coding. There are a few lectures that I'll throw some slides up to talk to, but everything else is just going through code together, talking about how the frameworks are put together and used, and pointing out little weird bits of the languages.

There's a lot to learn here. You'll end up being fairly proficient in both JavaScript and Typescript, and we'll use two different data stores, mongoDB and redis. Two frameworks, too: Node/Express and Angular. Along the way you'll pick up techniques for authentication, providing structure to mongo's unstructured store, some testing tools, building out APIs and more. It's a lot of code. If you don't enjoy coding and learning new languages, you might think about taking something else.

We're using Webstorm as an IDE for all of this, and it's probably useful for you to get that installed before class starts. If you are installing Node, grab the 'Current' version from nodejs.org (19.4 at the moment). It's actually simpler to install Node first, and then Webstorm, so that Webstorm will pick up the Node engine. Webstorm is available from JetBrains at https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm, and you can grab a free license at https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students.

Take a look at the syllabus, and if you have any questions, drop 'em here on Piazza. I'll see you all on the 19th in SCI-117.
